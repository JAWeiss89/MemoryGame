# MemoryGame
## Simple app used to practice working with DOM and localStorage using vanilla javascript.
### Bugs still to be fixed :
* Error caused when user clicks on new card before two exposed cards flip back down
* Made only for chrome browser. Not supported in any other browser yet. 

### All images are pulled from:
* [PokemonDB](https://pokemondb.net)
* [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net)
* [Picsart](https://picsart.com) by user [kookie](https://picsart.com/u/kckichiv/stickers)

App strictly used for educational purposes and _not_ commercial. I do not own any of the images used for app.
